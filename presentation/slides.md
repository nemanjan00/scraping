### Who am I? <i class="fa fa-user fa-fw"></i> 

 * Web developer

 * Hacker

 * Cool ðŸ˜Ž

 * Narcisistic person

 * I do not f\*cking curse

---

### What is the best way for scraping? <i class="fa fa-trophy fa-fw"></i> 

 * What is best solution for specific case? 

 * What do you know the best? 

 * Something in between! 

---

### What this talk is not about? 

 * Scraping frameworks (most of which are very slow)

 * Every single way you can scrap something

 * Theoretical talk

---

### What is this talk about? 

 * Web scraping

 * Technology you are going to have to deal with

 * Tools for understanding what you are dealing with

 * Ways for scraping that turned out to be working for me

 * Discussion about which solution is working for which problem

 * Bonus: Android application reversing

 * Bonus: SWF application reversing

 * Bonus: Sniffing HTTP/HTTPS

---

### How does data get to your browser

 * Initial HTML

 * HTTP Request (AJAX)

 * WebSockets

 * Local storage (LocalStorage, IndexedDB, WebSQL...)

---

### Where can I see initial HTML? 

 * Go to page

 * Press Ctrl + U (chrome) / Type "view-source:" before address (firefox)

---

### HTTP requests from JavaScript / forms? 

 * Can be sniffed using Chrome Developer Tools

  * Ctrl + Shift + i

  * Network tab

  * Disable cache

  * Enable "Preserve log" (only for forms)

  * Pick XHR filter (only for JS requests)

  * Trigger request

---

### Websockets

 * Websock = Socket (Full Duplex, Persistant) over HTTP

 * Can be sniffed using Chrome Developer Tools

  * Ctrl + Shift + i

  * Network tab

  * Disable cache

  * Pick WS filter

  * Refresh page

  * Pick websocket

 * Easiest to scrape using Asynchronous Languages

---

### Local storage

 * You can just delete all content from local storage and figure our how it is filled

 * You can read local storage from browser profile

---

### HTML parsing

 * Do not use parsers

```php
$items = [];

$lists = explode("<ul>", $data); // Split by opening tag
$list = $lists[1]; // Take first one. Index 0 is for stuff before tag... 

$listItems = explode("<li>", $list); // Split again by another tag

unset($listItems[0]); // Delete stuff before first tag

forEach($listItems as $item){
	$item = explode("<", $item)[0]; // Get something from tag

	$items[] = $item; // Add it to array
}
```
---

### Unpredictable scraping path && no branching

* Synchronous languages (PHP in my case)

#### Pros

 * Easier to write

 * No too much need for nesting

 * Not too aggressive when it comes to traffic (slow by default)

#### Cons

 * Slow for branching. 

 * You touch it, you buy it.

### Predictable scraping path || a lot of branching 

* Asynchronous languages (Node.JS in my case)

#### Pros

 * Crazy fast

 * Simpler to scale

 * Powerful error handling

#### Cons

 * Can be too fast

 * Sometimes hard to track status

.footnote[[Example](https://github.com/nemanjan00/scraping/tree/master/example2) and [scraper](https://github.com/nemanjan00/scraping/tree/master/example2-scraper)]

---

### Keep calm and fuzz input

 * Two golden rules

  * Try to manipulate very single input

  * If it works without non-crucial input, remove it

---

### HTTP headers

---

### Cookie storage

---

### Binary search

---

### Anti antiscraping

---

### Uglified JavaScript

---

### Webpack

---

### Getting Android application source code (almost)

---

### Getting SWF application source code (almost)

---

### Sniffing HTTP/HTTPS
