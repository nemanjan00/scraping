### Single page scraping

 * Do not use parsers

```php
$items = [];

$lists = explode("<ul>", $data); // Split by opening tag
$list = $lists[1]; // Take first one. Index 0 is for stuff before tag... 

$listItems = explode("<li>", $list); // Split again by another tag

unset($listItems[0]); // Delete stuff before first tag

forEach($listItems as $item){
	$item = explode("<", $item)[0]; // Get something from tag

	$items[] = $item; // Add it to array
}
```

### Unpredictable scraping path

* Synchronous languages

#### Pros

 * Easier to write

 * No too much need for nesting

 * Not too aggressive when it comes to traffic (slow by default)

#### Cons

 * Slow for branching. 

 * You touch it, you buy it.
